Direct and diffuse solar radiation are the main drivers. The solar irradiance at the TOA minus the radiation that is reflected or absorbed in the clear atmosphere gives the upper limit for the incoming shortwave radiation. The daily average plot above shows this quite well.\n",

The higher relative humidity, the lower the incoming shortwave radiation, in general\n",

These dry conditions (see also RH) cause a stronger latent heat flux (evaporation, sublimation) into the atmosphere, giving negative $Q_L$.

    "Roughness lengths are needed for the approximation of turbulent fluxes, However, they are hard to determine and very sensitive to a variety of influences. The roughness length for momentum on a glacier may vary widely e.g. between freshly fallen snow and a pure glacial ice surface. This problem is assessed also in the literature, which provides an idea of the range for the values of these roughness lengths.\n",
    "Ambach (1986) assumes wind (momentum) roughness lengths $z_{0m}$ of $2 \\cdot 10^{-3} m$ for snow and $1 \\cdot 10^{-4} m$ for ice surfaces. This wide range seems very imprecise, but considering that both cases are realistic for a glacier, it simply shows the uncertainty based on temporal changes of the surface. For $z_{0h}$ (temperature) and $z_{0v}$ (water vapor) a value of $6 \\cdot 10^{-6} m$ can be assumed (Ambach, 1986). Roughness lengths over an antarctic ice shelf were assessed in King et al. (1994). In their study they found a smaller roughness length for momentum of $z_{0m} \\approx 5.6 \\cdot 10^{-5} m$. Temperature and water vapor flux are again assumed to be equal and a value of $z_{0v} \\approx z_{0h} \\approx 5.1 \\cdot 10^{-2} m$ is given.\n",

    "There is a good summary about this topic in Hock (2005):\n",
    "\n",
    "> *One problem concerns the specification of roughness lengths. They can\n",
    "be derived from detailed measurements of wind, temperature and humidity profiles. However, these are seldom available and the roughness lengths are often estimated from published data (e.g., Greuell and Oerlemans, 1989; Konzelmann and Braithwaite, 1995). This poses a problem because the roughness lengths for wind reported over snow and ice vary by several orders of magnitude (summaries in Moore, 1983; Braithwaite, 1995a) ranging from 0.004 mm (Inoue, 1989) to 70 mm (Jackson and Carroll, 1978) over snow and from 0.003 mm (Antarctic blue ice\n",
    "area; Bintanja and van den Broeke, 1995) to 120 mm (van den Broeke, 1996) over glacier ice. Generally, [$z_{0m}$]-values of a few mm tend to\n",
    "be assumed in glacier applications. Changes in [$z_{0m}$] and [$z_{0h}$] by one order of magnitude can result in differences in the turbulent heat fluxes by a factor of two (Munro, 1989; Hock and Holmgren, 1996) demonstrating the significance of accurate roughness length determination. The relationship between the roughness lengths of wind, heat and vapour pressure is another matter of discussion. The principle of similarity is often invoked (e.g., Streten and Wendler, 1968; Hay and Fitzharris, 1988; Brun et al., 1989; Munro, 1989; Zuo and Oerlemans, 1996), although there is evidence that the surface roughnesses for heat and vapour pressure are smaller than [$z_{0m}$] by one or two orders of magnitude (Sverdrup, 1935; Holmgren, 1971; Ambach, 1986; Beljaars and Holtslag, 1991; Smeets et al., 1998). Conversely, Morris et al. (1994) concluded the opposite from energy-balance modelling, namely that z 0T and [$z_{0v}$] were considerably larger than the aerodynamic roughness\n",
    "lengths. Data analysis from Greenland gave values for [$z_{0h}$] of about 10 to 100 times larger than [$z_{0m}$] (Calanca, 2001). Braithwaite (1995a) suggests that the assumption of unequal roughness lengths is not strictly necessary, because an ‘effective roughness length’ satisfying  [$z_{0m} \\approx z_{0v} \\approx z_{0h}$] can be chosen so that the exchange coefficient gives the same value when applying equations 24 and 25. The roughness length of vapour pressure is\n",
    "generally assumed to be equal to the one for heat. However, very few studies, exist due to the inherent difficulty of accurately measuring vapour pressure profiles over glaciers. In addition, roughness lengths will vary in space and time (Plüss and Mazzoni, 1994; Greuell and Konzelmann, 1994; Calanca, 2001). Holmgren (1971) observed an increase\n",
    "in roughness lengths with decreasing wind speed; Anderson (1976) a decrease with time during the snow melt season.*\n",

One major issue with this mass balance are the missing precipitation values from 2011-09-16 00:00:00 to 2012-04-30 23:00:00. This makes the accurate computation of the total mass balance impossible. However, when comparing the snowfall values for this period from the year before, it may be, that during this period there was no significant snowfall (TODO: check with SR50). So assuming, that the contribution by snowfall during this period is near zero, leads to a total mass loss of about 5.5 m during the measurement period. With respect to the ongoing climate change and melting of glaciers, this seems to be in the range of a realistic value. (TODO: check literature)"
